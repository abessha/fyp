                <p>Hi, thank you for coming on such short notice and welcome to Matrix Manor! Our in-house engineer is preoccupied currently, 
                    so we'd be very grateful if you could help fix these elevators. It is going to be very different to the usual 
                    procedure of fixing elevators, if you couldn't tell already the owner of this hotel has a strange obsession with 
                    matrices, something about his Computer Science days, but I digress. To get the elevator working again you have to
                    complete some matrix calculations, each elevator is built around a different type of matrix calculation. I 
                    understand this must be an absurd request but with a very hectic day at the hotel already, none of the other
                    staff have time to tackle it, and we'll be sure to reward you generously. Our engineer let us know its not too complicated
                    and you just have to fit in the correct pieces to get the system up and running again. Our owner actually gave your details 
                    to us, as he knew you have some knowledge in matrices, but no worries if it's been a while for you, our engineer left us a basic
                    guide to the system when he first built them so you can always check that. Good luck with the job!</p>
